To run the analyses:

% pwd
/Users/philip/Documents/Research/prospect-theory/experiments/peak-end/analysis

Run this once to process the logs:
% ./parse_peak-end.py ../run-logs/*.txt > peak-end

Run these to do the analyses:
% ./analyse_peak-end.R peak-end
% ./analyse_pref-ranks.R peak-end

You might need to install some packages, but I assume you're a master at R now.
